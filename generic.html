									<h2>What are the kinds of video gaming?</h2>
									<p>Video games come in many types, each offering unique experiences. Action games are fast-paced, focusing on fighting or shooting (Call of Duty, Super Mario Bros.), while adventure games involve exploration and storytelling (The Legend of Zelda, Uncharted). RPGs let players take on character roles, level up, and complete quests (Final Fantasy, Skyrim), and simulation games mimic real-life activities like building or flying (The Sims, SimCity). Strategy games require planning to outsmart opponents (Age of Empires, StarCraft), and sports games recreate activities like soccer or racing (FIFA, NBA 2K). Puzzle games test problem-solving skills (Tetris, Candy Crush), while horror games are designed to scare players (Resident Evil, Outlast). Multiplayer online games let players compete or cooperate with others (Fortnite, League of Legends), and platformers focus on jumping and navigating levels (Super Mario Bros., Sonic the Hedgehog). Fighting games feature one-on-one combat (Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat), shooters focus on shooting enemies (Counter-Strike, Overwatch), party games are fun for groups (Mario Party, Jackbox Party Pack), and survival games challenge players to gather resources and stay alive (Minecraft, ARK: Survival Evolved).</p>
